            Every candidate to join our affiliate program should understand that
            we are constantly trying to be hacked and harmed in some way. This
            is why we pay a lot of attention to the candidates who join our
            partnership program. When joining, a lot of factors are taken into
            consideration, such as the reputation on the forums, the team
            composition, evidence of work with other affiliate programs, your
            wallet balance, the amount of previous payments and much more. You
            can also join our team by a guarantee of our partners, who are

            After many years of experience, we concluded that the most effective
            way to test a candidate for accession is a deposit. When you join,
            you deposit 1 bitcoin in our wallet, in fact, this amount is an
            advance and will be used at your subsequent payments as payment for
            our 20% share. For example, the company paid you a ransom for
            decrypting 100 bitcoins, you have to transfer a share of 20 bitcoins
            to us, but thanks to the deposit you made when you joined, the
            amount of the share paid will be 19 bitcoins. This procedure is
            required only once, only when you join the affiliate program. The
            deposit weeds out insecure newbies, cops, FBI agents, journalists,
            white haters, web pentesters, competitors, and other small rodent
            pests. The deposit amount may be reduced or not required at all,
            depending on what reputation you have and what information you can
            provide about yourself. For those who are afraid to trust us with
            their money and think that we are scammers, it is possible to carry
            out this procedure through a guarantor, any reputable forum, in this
            case, you make a deposit on the balance of the forum, where we
            describe the conditions of the deposit, which are very simple, for
            example, if you can not earn 5 bitcoins in a month, then your
            deposit goes to us.

            Please, be understanding with such a careful attitude to your
            candidacy, because you personally would not be very pleased if your
            newly encrypted company was decrypted for free by the FBI thanks to
            some person who easily gained access to the panel and made a
            masterful hack of our servers using zero-day vulnerabilities.

        <BoldText text="Recommended, but not required, application form when joining:"></BoldText>
        <Text2>
          1) Links to your profiles on various hacker forums - the older your
          account, the better.
          <br />
          2) Describe your experience with other affiliate programs, preferably
          with some evidence, such as screenshots and transactions that show
          your payouts.
          <br />
          3) Show your balance in cryptocurrency at the moment.
          <br />
          4) Explain the reasons why you left another affiliate program and want
          to work with us.
          <br />
          5) Tell about the current accesses you have and are ready to attack
          immediately after joining us. It is recommended to prove yourself
          immediately after joining - the sooner you get the first payment, the
          less doubt will be cast on your identity.
          <br />
          6) It is desirable to have already downloaded information for the blog
          from the intended target for the attack and provide evidence of the
          existence of this information, such as screenshots, file tree or
          access to these files.
          <br />
          7) Ask your friends or acquaintances who already work with us to vouch
          for you.
          <br />
          8) Request a bitcoin or monero wallet to make a deposit, in case you
          are confident in your abilities and ready to earn millions of dollars
          with us.
        </Text2>
        <BoldText text="To summarize, the reasons why it is better to work with us:"></BoldText>
        <Text2>
          Dispossessor brand - the whole planet knows about us, we are trusted
          by encrypted companies, we have shown everyone that it is safe to
          cooperate with us, we are responsible for our words, we have never
          cheated anyone and always fulfill our agreements. Decrypter work,
          stolen data is deleted.
          <br />
          Stability: we have been working for 3 years, and no negative news
          regarding ransomware could scare and stop us, and so far we could not
          be caught by the FBI. If they couldn't catch us in 3 years, they
          probably never will, and we will keep working.
          <br />
          Probably the best software and the most extensive list of operating
          systems and architectures you can attack.
          <br />
          You negotiate and make all the decisions yourself.
          <br />
          Payments to your wallet: there is no way we can cheat you and commit
          exit scams, as many affiliate programs have done and will continue to
          do. In addition, in 3 years we have earned a lot of money, so much so
          that there is no point in ruining your reputation because of some
          insignificant amount of a few million dollars.
          <br />
          We store stolen company data for as long as possible on our blog so
          that companies are afraid to allow leaks and pay for stolen data if
          there are backups and there is no need to pay for a decrypter.
          <br />
          We have no payout limits - you can encrypt RDP individuals or
          companies with any income level, any payout is nice for us - both
          $5,000,000 and $50 million, because we love our work and the process
          itself, and money is just a nice addition.
          <br />
          The best anti-ddos protection and a lot of mirrors, stability of
          communication with companies is very important for getting payouts.
          <br />
          Possibility to create private chats for secret communication with
          Recovery companies: it is very useful to keep secrecy of
          correspondence and avoid disrupting negotiations.
          <br />
          Decrypter security: the maximum protection for decrypters allows you
          to be sure that your company will not be decrypted for free due to any
          vulnerabilities in the web panel.
          <br />
          Bug bounty program: we understand that there is always a possibility
          of zero-day vulnerability attacks and we fight this threat with all
          possible means.
